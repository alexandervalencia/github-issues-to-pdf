# GitHub Issues to PDF
### A program to help collect GitHub issues as PDF files.

## Note: Node v8+ required to run GitHub Issues to PDF

## Installation
1. Clone or Download GitHub Issues to PDF (GIP).
2. Run `npm install` inside the folder containing GIP.
3. To avoid GitHub API limits create your own [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), GIP will ask you for it the first time you run it.
4. From the command line, navigate to the GIP folder and run `npm start`

The pdfs will render to `./rendered_pdfs`; if the folder does not exist yet, it will be created.
